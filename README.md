Hospital Appointment Booking System is a Python software built with Tkinter. It provides a simple way to book appointments in a hospital. The user can book, view, and cancel appointments through a simple and user-friendly interface. The system has several screens, including a welcome screen, main menu, booking form, appointment viewer, and cancellation screen. The booking process includes selecting a doctor, filling in patient information, and selecting a time. Simple checks are in place to make sure users fill in required information prior to booking an appointment.

The most important functionality is fine, but the project is incomplete. We will add a calendar for selecting dates, a dropdown to select time, and an option to save appointment details so that it is still available even after closing the app in the future. Planned upgrades include the addition of a doctor search feature, email notifications, and an administrative interface for hospital personnel. In all, the project lays a good groundwork for a more extensive scheduling system and demonstrates key programming principles like modular design, event handling, and secure input validation.
